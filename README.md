# PluginTesting
Simple plugin system for a future project

Very simple plugin system that dynamically compiles local files into .dll(s) and adds them into the program. There isn't much to show in terms of usage, just look at the example bot provided. I will be using this to create an open source Skype bot in the future, utilizing my own API. (Skype4Sharp)
